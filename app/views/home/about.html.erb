<p> Hashat is a community of tattoo art and the stories behind them. <p>

<p> It was born when 3 art-loving women, Tina (@tinapshah), Shannon (@), and Doa (@), learned how to code in 10 weeks at Austin's first development bootcamp, the MakersSquare. <p>

<p> Hashtat lives through both the emotional and financial support from those that profoundly care about creation and art. Thanks for your consideration.<p>

<p> We stand on the shoulders of those patient few teachers that believed in us. Credits: MakerSquare founders and classmates, Matt Buck, Mike O., Nathaniel, Micah, Aron, Scott, Mando, Nick, Damon, Christina, Sam, Matt, Andres <p>
